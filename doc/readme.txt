eZ Unique Datatypes extension for eZ Publish 4.0
version 0.5 beta

What is it?
-----------

This is a collection of common datatypes whose validation has been extended
so to verify their uniqueness within given content object attribute. Otherwise,
these datatypes behave exactly as their prototypes.

Currently there are two datatypes provided:
- Unique string (based on Text line system datatype),
- Unique URL (based on URL system datatype).

Use these if you want to make sure that a given attribute of a given class
never accepts/stores two identical values.

Note: uniqueness is validated within the same attribute only, which means that
if you use the datatype in two different classes, it will become two
independent attributes resulting in two independent uniqueness sets! This may
be changed/enhanced in the future.

Note:
# Versions 0.1-0.3 (strings), 0.1-0.4 (URLs):
Uniqueness is validated globally, which means it will not skip content
objects that are drafts, in trash, or unpublished versions! However, multiple
versions of the same content object may store the same value (in fact, it would
not work otherwise).
# Versions 0.4+ (string), 0.5+ (URLs):
New feature for strings available: possible to check current versions only.
# For backward compatibility set: CurrentVersionOnly=false
